# NestBudget

NestBudget is a simple personal finance management app built with NestJS.

## Overview

This is my first app built with NestJS. It allows users to:

- Add income and expenses
- View list of all transactions
- See account balance summary (income - expenses)

All data is stored in-memory and lost on restart. 

Swagger API documentation has been added to the app.

## Getting Started

To run the app:

1. Clone the repo and cd into project folder
2. Run `npm install` 
3. Start with `npm run start`
4. Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api`

The app is built for learning purposes to explore NestJS.
